## Xiang Li 李想
I'm Xiang Li 李想, a first year math PhD student of algebra and number theory in the University of Edinburgh working with Prof. [Minhyong Kim](https://www.minhyongkim.net/). My interests are in algebraic number theory and arithmetic geometry. To be more specific, I am interested in non-abelian Chabauty methods, which provide an efficient way to find rational points on a curve. I'm also interested in some mathematical physics such as topological quantum field theory and higher category.

## Experience

* **May 2023 The Modularity Theorem and the Modular Approach** (Cam)

  Supervisor: Dr. [Hanneke Wiersema](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~hw600/)

  Abstract: The goal of the essay is to show how the modularity theorem implies Fermat’s Last
Theorem (FLT). We begin the essay by discussing about elliptic curves, modular forms
and their Galois representations. Then we state the modularity theorem and Ribet’s level
lowering theorem. Next we study the properties of the Frey curve and its representations,
and apply those theorems to deduce FLT. Finally we make a short introduction on a general
version of modularity theorem.

* **Sep 2021 - Mar 2022 Group Project in Algebraic Geometry** (UoE) 

  Supervisor: Prof. [Ivan Cheltsov](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/cheltsov/) 
  
  Abstract: In this report we study smooth three dimensional hypersurfaces in P²×P² of bidegree (1,2).
  We show, via a detailed study of cubic curves, that, under generality conditions, these hypersurfaces (and therefore nets of conics) can be put into one of three standard forms by linear change of coordinates.

* **Jul 2021 - Sep 2021 Algebra Theorem Proving in Lean** (UoE)

  Supervisor: Prof. [Iain Gordon](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~igordon/) (Head of School and Chair of Mathematics)

  <!-- * Worked collaboratively on the research projects. Proved the algebraic theorems (e.g. the ring version of the Chinese Remainder Theorem) on Lean, an interactive theorem prover.
  * Sketched the proof of the structure theorem of finitely generated module over a PID on Lean.
  * Applied the methodology of combining mathematics, logic, and computer science. -->

  Supervisor: Associate Prof. [Xiaoming Du 杜晓明](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/math/2017/1229/c14638a318362/page.htm)

  * Mastered the knowledge of the uniformization theorem by reading the book Riemann Surface by Simon Donaldson in this seminar.
  * Used algebraic topology and differential manifolds as the tools.
