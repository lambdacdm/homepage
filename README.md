## Experience

* **Sep 2021 - Mar 2022 Group Project in Algebraic Geometry** (UoE) (to be completed)

  Supervisor: Prof. [Ivan Cheltsov](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/school-of-mathematics/people/a-z?person=27) 
  
  * Studied smooth and singular cubic curves, surfaces and their properties in the senior project.
  * Dealt with Hesse configuration and Hesse pencil.
  * Utilised projective plane and commutative algebra.
* **Jul 2021 - Sep 2021 Algebra Theorem Proving on Lean** (UoE)

  Supervisor: Prof. [Iain Gordon](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/school-of-mathematics/people/a-z?person=95) (Head of School and Chair of Mathematics)

  * Worked collaboratively on the research projects. Proved the algebraic theorems (e.g. the ring version of the Chinese Remainder Theorem) on Lean, an interactive theorem prover.
  * Sketched the proof of the structure theorem of finitely generated module over a PID on Lean.
  * Applied the methodology of combining mathematics, logic, and computer science.
