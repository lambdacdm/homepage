## Experience

**2021 Theorem Proving on Lean**

In the project, I and other participants got proofs of algebraic theorems on Lean, an interactive theorem prover. Concepts like equivalence classes and Lagrange theorem were implemented. This project combines mathematics, logic and computer science.

## Research Interest

I'm interested in Algebra. Specifically, I have read the following books in the respective fields:

* *Naive Lie Theory* by John Stillwell (Lie Algebra)

* *Basic Category Theory* by Tom Leinster (Category Theory)

* *Riemman Surface* by Simon Donaldson (Riemann Surface)
