## Awards

* **2021 Arthur Erdélyi Prize** (UoE)

  Up to three prizes, awarded on the basis of distinguished performance in the Degree Examination for Mathematics 3

* **2021 Dr Nigel Suess Prize** (UoE)

  awarded on the basis of distinguished performance in the course "Introduction to Number Theory"

## Experience

* **2021-2022 Group Project in Algebraic Geometry** (UoE) (to be completed)

  Supervisor: Prof. Ivan Cheltsov 
  
  Our goal is studying smooth and singular cubic curves, surfaces and their properties in this Year 4 project. My role is dealing with Hesse configuration so far. We mainly use the tool of the projective plane, and a bit of commutative algebra.

* **2021-2021 Algebra Theorem Proving on Lean** (UoE)

  Supervisor: Prof. Iain Gordon

  Our goal was getting proofs of algebraic theorems on Lean, an interactive theorem prover in this summer project. My role was proving the ring version of the Chinese Remainder Theorem on Lean. The mathedology is a combination of mathematics, logic, and computer science.


* **2019-2020 Riemann Surfaces** (SCUT)

  Supervisor: Associate Prof. Xiaoming Du

  Our goal was getting a basic understanding of the uniformization theorem by reading the book *Riemann Surface* by Simon Donaldson in this seminar. My role was reporting what I learned regularly. We used algebraic topology and differential manifolds as our tools.
