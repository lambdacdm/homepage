## Awards

* **2021 Arthur Erdélyi Prize** (UoE)

  Up to three prizes, awarded on the basis of distinguished performance in the Degree Examination for Mathematics 3

* **2021 Dr Nigel Suess Prize** (UoE)

  awarded on the basis of distinguished performance in the course "Introduction to Number Theory"
* **2019 National Scholarship** (SCUT)

  awarded for remarkbale students, funded by central government of China

## Experience

* **2021 Group Project in Algebraic Geometry** (UoE)

  This is the Year 4 project, which is expected to be completed by March 2022. We are studying smooth and singular cubic surfaces and their properties in the project.

* **2021 Theorem Proving on Lean** (UoE)

  In the project, I and other participants got proofs of algebraic theorems on Lean, an interactive theorem prover. What I did was proving the ring version of Chinese Remainder Theorem on Lean. This project combines mathematics, logic, and computer science.


* **2019 Riemann Surfaces** (SCUT)

  Participants in this project gained a basic understanding of Riemann Surfaces, including rudiments of manifolds, algebraic topology, and differential forms. The Uniformisation Theorem was also discussed, which gives a classification of Riemann surfaces.

<!-- ## Research Interest

I'm interested in Algebra. Specifically, I have read the following books in the respective fields:

* *Naive Lie Theory* by John Stillwell (Lie Algebra)

* *Basic Category Theory* by Tom Leinster (Category Theory)

* *Riemman Surface* by Simon Donaldson (Riemann Surface) -->
